// Often a component needs to maintain some internal state
// for example if there is interaction involved
// in this case a component function is not sufficient
// the component function can only has properties and no state
// we need a component class with a render function
var MyComponent = React.createClass({

  // used for type-checking of the properties
  // same as with the component function
  propTypes: {
    color: React.PropTypes.string,
  },

  // this method will be called by React
  // before the components gets mounted into the DOM
  getDefaultProps: function() {
    return {color: 'green'}
  },

  // this method will be called by React
  // before the components gets mounted into the DOM
  // if this method is missing, this.state will be undefined
  getInitialState: function() {
    // The state can be any JavaScript value, often it is an object
    return {times: 0}
  },

  // this method handles all the clicks on the <span> element
  handleClick: function() {
    // setState() can be called with an object that contains the new state
    // normally this triggers a call of render(), but React can batch multiple
    // calls and defer the render() call (make the call asynchronous)
    // To prevent this, setState can take a callback instead

    // This can lead to unexpected behaviour, if we rely on this.state or
    // this.props for our calculations
    // this.setState({times: this.state.times + 1})

    // The callback version doesn't have this problem
    // The callback gets the right state and props at time of the update
    this.setState(function(prevState, props) {
      return {times: prevState.times + 1}
    })

  },

  // this method will be called by React
  // after the component got mounted into the DOM
  // also every time this.setState() was called
  // it's like the component function from before
  // but without a props argument
  render: function() {

    // using the prop given by the creator of this component
    // properties are now in this.props instead of the props argument
    var style = {color: this.props.color}

    // returning an element with a click-handler and the props and
    // state values. state is stored in this.state
    return (
      <span onClick={this.handleClick} style={style}>
        Clicked {this.state.times} times
      </span>
    )

  },

})

// creating some instances of the interactive stateful component class
// one with default color
// Everything works exactly like with the simpler component functions
// The interface has not changed for the user of this component
var reactElement =
  <div>
    <MyComponent color='red'/>
    <br/>
    <MyComponent color='blue'/>
