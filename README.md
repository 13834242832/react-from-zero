I saw a increase in stars after posting this to HN yesterday, so I decided to write some more lessons.

If anyone has wishes/ideas for lessons, write an issue :)

## Update 24.03.2017

Updated React version and cleaned up code.

Changed the ref example to use function refs.

Added extra explanations to setState example.
