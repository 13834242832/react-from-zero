# React From Zero

A simple (99% ES2015 less) tutorial for React 

Everything runs in the browser without a manual pre-compilation.

No need for [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/), but I would recommend looking into it. It helped me to get rid of much Grunt/Gulp code in my projects.

## Update 28.04.2016

I saw a increase in stars after posting this to HN yesterday, so I decided to write some more lessons.

If anyone has wishes/ideas for lessons, write an issue :)
